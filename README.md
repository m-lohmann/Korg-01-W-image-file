# Korg-01-W-image-file

Preformatted and empty *Korg 01/W* compatible floppy disk image file (720 kB).

The image was formatted using a *Gotek SFRM72-TU100K* USB floppy emulator which got flashed with *FlashFloppy v. 2.14*.

Simply create as many copies of the `000.ST` image file as you want to create more virtual floppy disks. Copy them to the USB stick intended to be used with the (Gotek) USB floppy emulator, and rename them to your liking.
