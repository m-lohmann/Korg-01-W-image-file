# Korg-01-W-image-file

Preformatted and empty *Korg 01/W* compatible floppy disk image file (720 kB).

The image was formatted in a Korg 01/W Pro with a *Gotek SFRM72-TU100K* USB floppy emulator, which is flashed with *FlashFloppy v. 2.14*.

Simply create as many copies of the `000.ST` image file ([you can download it here](https://github.com/m-lohmann/Korg-01-W-image-file/releases)\) as you want to create more virtual floppy disks. Copy them to the USB stick intended to be used with the (Gotek) USB floppy emulator, and rename them to your liking.
